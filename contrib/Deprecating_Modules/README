By default it is /path/to/lmod/etc/admin.list. You can override by
setting the env. var.  LMOD_ADMIN_FILE to point to any file you like.


The admin file consists of key: value pairs:

      moduleName/version:  message
     <blank line>

Or

     Full_PATH_to_Modulefile: message
     <blank line>

The message can be as many lines as you like.  The message ends
with a blank line.   Below is an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

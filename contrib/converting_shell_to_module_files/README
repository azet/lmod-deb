A new tool called "env2" will do conversions from shell scripts to Lua based and
TCL based modulefile along with a host of other conversions.  See
https://sourceforge.net/projects/env2/

As an example:

   $ env2 -from bash -to lmod /opt/apps/intel/13.0.2/bin/iccvars.sh intel64 > intel_13.0.2.lua


------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  The current version as of April 23, 2013 does not yet support lmod.
--  I have include my changed version here.  You should check to see
--  if there is a more recent version then the one I have included here.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  The one I here doesn't support arguments so for the intel compiler
--  shell script I had to modify it to assume that if there are no arguments
--  to assume "intel64"
------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
--  As of Feb 22, 2014 there is new command added:  "sh_to_modulefile"
--  which converts bash scripts to lmod modulefiles.  It supports shell
--  script options.

One of dadi's main benefits is speed: fitting a two-population model typically takes around 10 minutes, and run time is independent of the number of SNPs in your data set. dadi is also flexible, handling up to three simultaneous populations, with arbitrary timecourses for population size and migration, plus the possibility of admixture and population-specific selection. The code is young but has already been used in several publications. - Homepage: https://code.google.com/d/dadi/

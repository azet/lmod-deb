    puts stderr {   Set of GNU Core Utils with Mutil 1.76.6 Patches. Mutil provides mcp and msum, which are drop-in replacements for cp and md5sum that utilize multiple types of parallelism to achieve maximum
copy and checksum performance on clustered file systems
Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as
possible.  Read/write parallelism allows individual operations of a
single copy to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O.  Multi-node
cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same
copy/checksum.  Split file processing allows multiple threads to
operate concurrently on the same file.  Finally, hash trees allow
inherently serial checksums to be performed in parallel.

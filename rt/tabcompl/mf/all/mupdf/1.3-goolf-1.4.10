MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more. It also reads XPS and OpenXPS documents. MuPDF is written modularly, so features can be added on by integrators if they so desire.Since the 1.2 release of MuPDF, we optionally support interactive features such as form form filling, javascript and transitions. - Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/mupdf/

Ideas for EB Hackaton for Lmod:

45 min talk about Lmod:

* Intro for Lmod
** what is Lmod 
** Features
** New Features
* Running Lmod on our Cray XC-40
** Show two trick for dealing with Cray modules and injecting the hierarchy
** Lmod Pager issues ?
* Questions for Hackathon
** Invisible Modules

Explain hidden versus invisible.



Crays have have many modules listed as available that don't make sense
craype-barcelona etc.   It may or may not make sense to make invisible
when there are 20 modules loaded by default that should never change.

Questions: How does making a module invisible affect the default
determination?

Can one load an invisible module?

Know all the modules that you currently have loaded? 


** Default handling
*** Remind everyone what the system cache 

TACC got Stampede with Xeon Phi's a.k.a MIC's

Wanted to mark modules that were MIC aware

=> Properties

=> Properties are in module files.  "module avail" now needs to know
the contents of every modulefile. This is slow to read every file. 
=> Spider Cache

*** Chosing a Default module is was complex before.

How Lmod Picks the Default when there are multiple directories listed
in MODULEPATH

1) The first marked default is chosen in MODULEPATH Order
2) Highest version across all directories

Please note that all directories are considered before picking the default.

Also node that Lmod only puts (D) next to the module name in avail for
the one that is the default.  In other words for a given module name there is
only one default independent of how many marked defaults or highest
versions there are.

*** ~/.modulrc and system MODULERC file problem w.r.t. System cache

I learn more about many things one can do with Tmod.
With ~/.modulerc (or the system one) can change the default.  That
currently doesn't work in Lmod.

In order for this to work there has to be enough information recorded
in the spider cache to make it so that the default can be choosen
WITHOUT walking the directory tree again.

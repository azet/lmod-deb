Lmod Hands-ons Tutorial:  Chose your own topic(s):

We have 5 different Topics for you to chose from.  We have provided a
USB thumb drive for you to take with you.  On the thumb drive is a
copy of the Virtual Box software for Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu and
Fedora and a VM for you to run.

Pleasem e install the virtual box software appropriate for your laptop.
Then invoke the Virtual Box Software on your laptop and "import" (from
the file menu) the XALT-Lmod.ova Virtual Machine (aka. VM).

Once it has been imported, start the VM.  The user account is xalt and
the password is also xalt.

Once you have logged in you are free to try out one or more of the
topics.  We will be around for you to ask questions.



Topic 1:  Using Lmod:

    This is topic that introduces Lmod to those who are new to Lmod.
    It shows many of the features that Lmod provides from a user's
    point of view.  Please see the Using_Lmod_XXXX worksheet to try this
    topic. 

Topic 2:  Using Lmod to create personal modules:

    This topic shows you how to leverage a Lmod installation to have
    personal modules.

    To start this topic start the firefox browser (found on the left
    side of the screen) and go to
    
       http://lmod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/020_advanced.html
    
    Then follow the instructions.  Note that the VM already contains
    the git-2.6.2.tar.gz source tar-ball.

Topic 3: Installing Lmod in a personal account:

    This topic shows how to install Lmod in your account.  This is a
    way to test Lmod when your site is running a different module
    system or you wish to test a new version of Lmod.

    To start this topic start the firefox browser (found on the left
    side of the screen) and go to
    
       http://lmod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/045_transition.html
    
    Then follow the instructions.  Note that Lua is already installed
    on the VM so feel to skip the installation of Lua if you like.  

    Note that both lua-5.1.4.5.tar.gz and Lmod-6.0.1.tar.bz2 have
    already been downloaded into the account.


Topic 4: How to install a System Spider cache:

    Lmod can speed up command like "module avail" and "module spider"
    with a system spider cache file.  This topic covers how to create
    one for your system and the issues involved.

    To start this topic start the firefox browser (found on the left
    side of the screen) and go to
    
       http://lmod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/130_spider_cache.html

    Your task is to create is to create a "system" spider cache in the
    xalt account on the VM.  Once you have this done please shows us
    what you did!  Once you have done this, try setting this up
    /opt/moduleData on the VM.  Note that the xalt account (password:
    xalt) can become root:

      $ sudo su -


Topic 5: How to write modulefiles for a system.

    Once you understand how to write application modulefiles like the
    ones discussed in Topic 2.  You might want to start wrestling with
    issues that come up with running Lmod on a big system.

    To start this topic start the firefox browser (found on the left
    side of the screen) and go to
    
       http://lmod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/015_writing_modules.html

    and

       http://lmod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/100_generic_modules.html

    This topic is open ended.  Here are a few tasks to test your
    understanding of the material.


    1) Create generic modulefiles for the ACME program  Here is the ACME
       executable:

          $ cat > acme
          #!bin/bash
          echo "Here acme program 1!"


      Create two version of this executable in ~/apps/acme/1.0 and
      ~/apps/acme/2.0 and modulesfiles ~/apps/mfiles/acme/1.0.lua and
      ~/apps/mfiles/acme/2.0.lua.  Test this with:

         $ module use ~/apps/mfiles
         $ module load acme/1.0
         $ acme
         $ module load acme/2.0
         $ acme
         

    2) Create a module called ~/mfiles/StdEnv.lua which works like the
    TACC module described in the documentation.  For this modulefile
    have it load gcc and mpich and try load xalt. Test this with:


        $ module use ~/apps/mfiles
        $ module purge
        $ module load StdEnv
        $ module list

How to report a bug in Lmod
===========================

Lmod has some built-in tools to make debugging possible on your site.
The first feature of Lmod is the configuration report::

   $ module --config

This reports how Lmod has been configured at build time as well as any
``LMOD_*`` environment variables set.  The second tool is the debug
output also built-in to Lmod::

  $ module -D load foo 2> load.log

The ``-D`` option turns on the debug printing and will report all the
steps that Lmod took to load a module called ``foo``.  Note that the
configuration report is at the top of every debug output.

Steps to report a bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test your bug against the latest release from github. Please pull
   the HEAD branch.
#. Try to reduce the problem to the fewest number of modules.  Shoot
   for 1 or 2 modulefiles if you can.
#. Run the command that fails.  i.e. ``module -D`` `cmd module ...` 2>
   lmod.log``
#. Combine the lmod.log file, the modulefiles from step 2, and possibly
   the spider cache file into a tar file.
#. Send the tar file to mclay@tacc.utexas.edu

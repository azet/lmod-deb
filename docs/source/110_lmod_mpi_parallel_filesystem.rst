#. Mention Bash startup: What does a non-prompt non-login interactive
   shell mean.
#. MPI startup: non-login interactive shells.
#. Lustre and MDS and finding a module.
#. ibrun passing of the environment
#. Why unguarded module commands are a problem
#. Why TACC makes the module command a no-op when on a compute node.
